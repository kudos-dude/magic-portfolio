# Cypress

This testing library is incredibly powerful, and acts as a Javascript version of what has been seen in the past in libraries such as Selenium.

I'm including the example tests for the purpose of showing you why I chose this library for my personal projects.

Unfortunately due to time constraints, I am unable to write end-to-end tests for the current project.

Once I have more time on this project, I plan to write tests that will perform the positive and negative flows for all user stories.

To run the Cypress example tests, type `npm run test:e2e` in the console
